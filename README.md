# QMUL_Assignments

This repository contains assignments and projects completed as part of the **Master's in Computer Science** program at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). It showcases coursework across three specialized subjects, reflecting a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application in computer science.

## Courses Included

### Machine Learning
- Assignments focused on designing, implementing, and evaluating machine learning models and algorithms using Python.
- Topics include supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, and performance optimization.

### Functional Programming (Haskell)
- Exploration of functional programming paradigms through Haskell.
- Emphasis on immutability, higher-order functions, and type systems.

### Semi-Structured Data Engineering (XML)
- Work involving the management and processing of semi-structured data using XML, XPath, XQuery, and XSLT.
- Topics include data transformation, schema design, and querying techniques.

## Repository Structure
Each course is organized into its dedicated folder, containing:
- **Source code:** Scripts and configuration files for each assignment.
- **Datasets:** Relevant datasets or supporting materials.
- **Documentation:** Reports and documentation detailing the implementation and outcomes.
- **Assignment Instructions:** Original instructions and requirements for each task.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a structured archive of the assignments, showcasing the skills and knowledge acquired during the program. It is a valuable resource for:
- Reference
- Further learning
- Collaboration
